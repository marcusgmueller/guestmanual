# Door Lock


So that you are not dependent on fixed check-in and check-out times, we have equipped the house with an electronic locking system.

outside

You will find a number field on the outside, to the right of the front door. Here you can simply enter your personal 6-digit access code to the house and the front door will open. To lock the front door from the outside, pull the door handle upwards and enter your personal access code again on the number field.

inside

To open and lock the front door from the inside, briefly press the button on the locking cylinder once. Before locking, please pull the door handle upwards. Alternatively, you can also turn the knob.
