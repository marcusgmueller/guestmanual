# Stay

## Access to the house

So that you are not dependent on fixed check-in and check-out times, we have equipped the house with an electronic locking system.

[https://youtu.be/WfkLC-PyWAg](https://youtu.be/WfkLC-PyWAg)

outside

You will find a number field on the outside, to the right of the front door. Here you can simply enter your personal 6-digit access code to the house and the front door will open. To lock the front door from the outside, pull the door handle upwards and enter your personal access code again on the number field.

## Site plan of the plant

## Internet access

The following WLAN network can be used free of charge in the house. You can find the access data on the display in the house.

<aside>
üí° If the tenant visits chargeable websites or enters into liabilities, the resulting costs shall be borne by him. He is obliged to comply with the applicable law when using the WLAN. He shall in particular:

1. not use the WLAN to retrieve or disseminate immoral or unlawful content
2. not to unlawfully reproduce, distribute or make accessible any copyrighted goods; this applies in particular in connection with the use of file-sharing programmes
3. observe the applicable regulations for the protection of minors
4. not to send or distribute harassing, defamatory or threatening content
5. not use the WLAN to send mass messages (spam) and/or other forms of inadmissible advertising.
</aside>

## Ventilate

The house should be ventilated several times a day and if water vapour forms (also upstairs). The doors in the house should be kept open if possible.

## Parking

During your stay there is a car park available (see map of the complex). This is marked with the number 62. Please do not use any other parking spaces in the complex. There is a limited number of visitor parking spaces at the entrance to the complex.

## Waste

Blue and yellow rubbish bags are available under the stairs for the disposal of rubbish. Waste may only be disposed of in these bags.

The full bags can be disposed of in the facility at the waste collection point (see plan of the facility). The transponder (see key) is needed to access the collection point. You will also find glass and paper containers here.
If the bags are used up, they can be purchased from Delhaize individually or as a roll.

## Extractor fan

The extractor fan has a circuit breaker that allows it to operate only when the kitchen window is open.

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è If you use the fireplace and the extractor fan in the kitchen at the same time, the odourless and colourless CO gas can form. - Danger to life - For this reason it is essential to have a window wide open.

</aside>

## Hot water

The hot water supply in the house is provided by an instantaneous water heater, which is installed in the bathroom.

<aside>
üí° The setting on the instantaneous water heater is already set correctly. No manual change to the setting is necessary.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° If hot water is used in the kitchen, only cold water may be available in the bathroom.

</aside>

<aside>
üí° At times it is difficult to achieve a constant water temperature in the kitchen and bathroom. This is not due to a defect in the instantaneous water heater, but is caused by the highly fluctuating water pressure in the system. The following tips can help:

- First set the tap to hot and when hot water flows constantly, slowly regulate it to the desired temperature.
- Let the hot water run for a few minutes until the temperature remains constant.
- Turn on a second tap until the temperature is constant and then turn it off again.
</aside>

## TV

All TVs in the house are equipped with Roku sticks. This means that only one remote control is required for operation.

### S**witching on and off**

There is a red button at the top of the remote control for this purpose.

### Volume control

The volume is controlled with the buttons on the side of the remote control.

### Programme selection

The TV is used via various apps (similar to a smartphone). There are apps for TV channels (ARD, ZDF, RTL etc.), for streaming services (Amazon Prime, Netflix, Apple TV etc.) or other video services such as YouTube. Most services can be used without registration and subscription. For some services, such as Netflix, a paid subscription is necessary. If you already use Netflix at home, for example, you can simply and conveniently log in on the TV set with your access data and watch your films.

<aside>
üí° Please do not forget to log out of all TV services to which you have logged in with your own access data before you leave.

</aside>

### **Apple AirPlay**

All Roku devices have Apple AirPlay. If you have an Apple device, you can wirelessly play content from your own device on the TV. To do this, you need to be connected to the Wi-Fi in your home.

[https://youtu.be/eMPVtMreSGc](https://youtu.be/eMPVtMreSGc)

The firewood is on the woodpile next to the shed.

**Selecting the firewood**.

Please use the wood moisture meter when selecting the firewood. This is located in the plastic box in the shed. The following results for the wood moisture values:

| moist | Suitability for heating |
| --- | --- |
| 6-15  | Optimal for heating - High calorific value |
| 16 - 20 | Restricted heating - Low calorific value |
| 21 - 44 | Not suitable for heating - Further drying necessary |

Adjustment of the chimney:

1.open all ventilation flaps on the fireplace
2. stack kindling and firelighter in the fireplace
3. light the fireplace
4. as soon as the fireplace is burning, you can slowly add larger and larger logs.

<aside>
‚ö†Ô∏è

- Under no circumstances should paper or other waste be burnt, nor should treated wood residues be burnt.
- Never leave the fireplace burning unattended (even an ember in the fireplace can reignite).
- If you use the fireplace and the extractor fan in the kitchen at the same time, the odourless and colourless CO gas can form. - Danger to life - For this reason it is essential to have a window wide open.
</aside>

### Night storage heater

The house has a night storage heater in the living room in addition to the fireplace.
This is an electric heating system that produces heat at night and stores it in heating
and stores it in heating bricks for the day.

The heating is controlled by two regulators:

Charging

Directly on the night storage heater, on the right-hand side, there is an adjustment wheel with four levels. this is used to regulate the amount of heat stored at night. We ask you to change this setting only after consultation.

Room temperature control

You can regulate the room temperature on the temperature controller next to the front door above the light switches. Otherwise, the temperature is regulated as follows:

| 8:00 Uhr - 22:00 Uhr | 21¬∞ C |
| --- | --- |
| 22:00 Uhr - 8:00 Uhr | 15¬∞ C |

We are also happy to adapt this heating programme to your needs.

<aside>
üí° During the summer months, the night storage heater is deactivated by default. If you would like it to be activated, i.e. if it is too cold for you, please let us know.
