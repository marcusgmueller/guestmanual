# TV

All TVs in the house are equipped with Roku sticks. This means that only one remote control is required for operation.

### S**witching on and off**

There is a red button at the top of the remote control for this purpose.

### Volume control

The volume is controlled with the buttons on the side of the remote control.

### Programme selection

The TV is used via various apps (similar to a smartphone). There are apps for TV channels (ARD, ZDF, RTL etc.), for streaming services (Amazon Prime, Netflix, Apple TV etc.) or other video services such as YouTube. Most services can be used without registration and subscription. For some services, such as Netflix, a paid subscription is necessary. If you already use Netflix at home, for example, you can simply and conveniently log in on the TV set with your access data and watch your films.

ðŸ’¡ Please do not forget to log out of all TV services to which you have logged in with your own access data before you leave.

### **Apple AirPlay**

All Roku devices have Apple AirPlay. If you have an Apple device, you can wirelessly play content from your own device on the TV. To do this, you need to be connected to the Wi-Fi in your home.
