**Selecting the firewood**.

Please use the wood moisture meter when selecting the firewood. This is located in the plastic box in the shed. The following results for the wood moisture values:

| moist | Suitability for heating |
| --- | --- |
| 6-15  | Optimal for heating - High calorific value |
| 16 - 20 | Restricted heating - Low calorific value |
| 21 - 44 | Not suitable for heating - Further drying necessary |

{: .warning }
- Under no circumstances should paper or other waste be burnt, nor should treated wood residues be burnt.
- Never leave the fireplace burning unattended (even an ember in the fireplace can reignite).
- If you use the fireplace and the extractor fan in the kitchen at the same time, the odourless and colourless CO gas can form. - Danger to life - For this reason it is essential to have a window wide open.

### Night storage heater

The house has a night storage heater in the living room in addition to the fireplace.
This is an electric heating system that produces heat at night and stores it in heating
and stores it in heating bricks for the day.

The heating is controlled by two regulators:

Charging

Directly on the night storage heater, on the right-hand side, there is an adjustment wheel with four levels. this is used to regulate the amount of heat stored at night. We ask you to change this setting only after consultation.

Room temperature control

You can regulate the room temperature on the temperature controller next to the front door above the light switches. Otherwise, the temperature is regulated as follows:

| 8:00 Uhr - 22:00 Uhr | 21¬∞ C |
| --- | --- |
| 22:00 Uhr - 8:00 Uhr | 15¬∞ C |

We are also happy to adapt this heating programme to your needs.

üí° During the summer months, the night storage heater is deactivated by default. If you would like it to be activated, i.e. if it is too cold for you, please let us know.
