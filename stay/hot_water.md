# Hot water

The hot water supply in the house is provided by an instantaneous water heater, which is installed in the bathroom.

{: .note }
The setting on the instantaneous water heater is already set correctly. No manual change to the setting is necessary. If hot water is used in the kitchen, only cold water may be available in the bathroom.
