## Waste

Blue and yellow rubbish bags are available under the stairs for the disposal of rubbish. Waste may only be disposed of in these bags. The full bags can be disposed of in the facility at the waste collection point (see plan of the park). The transponder (see key) is needed to access the collection point. You will also find glass and paper containers there. If the bags are used up, they can be purchased from Delhaize individually or as a roll.
